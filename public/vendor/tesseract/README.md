# Tesseract.js assets

This directory vendors the Tesseract.js 4.1.1 browser distribution so the OCR engine, worker script, WebAssembly binaries, and English language data can be served from the same origin. Loading these files locally avoids Content Security Policy violations that block blob workers or third-party CDNs.
